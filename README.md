### React Hooks are awesome

Used some hooks to create reusable form components(**custom hooks**). I tried these using the class component from **Pro React 16** by Adam Freeman.
Currently using bootstrap for these custom hooks, so styling is not customizable.

### Todo

[x] further try to **compose these hooks**

[x] Support **validation**(maybe using validate.js?)

[x] Support **custom styling**(maybe using **emotion.js**?)
